# hello-world

In this Web Design course, I hope to learn how to build responsive and visually appealing websites using modern tools and best practices. My goal is to understand both the design and coding aspects of web development, and to be able to create user-friendly websites that work well on all devices. Iâ€™m especially interested in improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
